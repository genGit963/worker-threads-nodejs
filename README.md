The **worker-threads-nodejs** project demonstrates multithreading in Node.js using the native `worker_threads` module. This library helps offload heavy computations or parallel tasks from the main thread, enhancing performance and responsiveness in CPU-intensive applications.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Parallel Processing**: Efficiently distribute tasks across multiple threads.
- **Non-Blocking Operations**: Free the main thread for other tasks.
- **Flexible API**: Easy-to-use functions for creating and managing worker threads.
- **Error Handling**: Robust handling of worker errors and thread terminations.
- **Real-World Examples**: Demonstrations of CPU-bound operations, file processing, and more.
